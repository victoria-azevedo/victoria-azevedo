I’m currently building a strong foundation in programming through academic and personal projects. I have experience with C#, having developed a game from scratch, as well as SQL for database fundamentals. <br>
I have also worked with HTML, CSS, and React by developing a website, and I’m currently learning JavaScript and Java to expand my understanding of software development. <br>
I’m focused on continuous learning, hands-on practice, and exploring different areas of technology to define my future specialization.
